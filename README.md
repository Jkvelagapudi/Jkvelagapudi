# Welcome to my Profile

##### My name is Jayadeep Velagapudi and I am currently a junior at Allen High School. I've been programming for 3 years now and I'm enjoying it so far (crossing my fingers it stays that way!). I love the notion of AI/ML and its uses and I'm currently learning AI through various courses. I'm self-taught (Well more like YouTube and Internet Taught) and it's been a fun journey. Currently, I'm in the Robotics Club and FRC Teams 5417 & 5488. I love growing as a programmer and I grow every time I get an error (which is a lot) and I am in pursuit of learning different languages at the moment. I love programming because it's very logical but also very creative and I feel like this combination of opposites combined with the control that the programmer has is beautiful. Another field I enjoy is engineering. I love CAD and 3D printing (with my Ender 3 pro) and I love creating things. STEAM is my passion and I truly enjoy it.
